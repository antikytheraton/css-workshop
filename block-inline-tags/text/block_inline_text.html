<!--
  Please wrap each of the following lines in either <div> or <span>s, so that the text
  makes sense with the layout. Please do not change the content of none of the lines.

  For example if such line:

    Red fox runs over the street.

  is wrapped in <span> it would become:

    <span>Red fox runs over the street.</span>

  If it's wrapped in <div>:

    <div>Red fox runs over the street.</div>
-->

<div>This sentence should be in on it's own line.</div>
<span>This</span>
<span>sentence</span>
<span>should</span>
<span>be</span>
<span>on</span>
<span>a</span>
<span>single</span>
<span>line.</span>
<div>This sentence, again, should be on it's own line.</div>
